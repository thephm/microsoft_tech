## People 

- [[Holly Pollock]] - saw she mentioned it on her LinkedIn profile 

## Notes 

- Loop components are available to everyone in your organization who has the link. It is not possible to make them available only to certain people, or to people outside your organization. 

- Your Loop components are saved automatically to your OneDrive. To see your components: https://office.com/mycontent

### The three elements of Loop 

- **Loop components** are portable pieces of content that stay in sync across all the places they are shared. Components allow you to collaborate in the flow of work – on a Loop page or in a chat, email, meeting, or document. They can be lists, tables, notes, and more - you’re always working with the latest information in your preferred app, like Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Word, Whiteboard, and the Loop app.

- **Loop pages** are flexible canvases in the Loop app where you can bring together people and all your components, links, tasks, and data. Loop pages can start small and continue to grow to match the size of your ideas. Loop pages can be shared across M365 apps as a link or as an embedded Loop component.

- **Loop workspaces** are shared spaces that allow you and your team to see and group everything important to your project, making it easy for you to catch up on what everyone is working on and track progress toward shared goals.

### 2023-10-21

From [4]

Loop workspaces and the content created in Loop workspaces are backed by [[Syntex]] [Syntex repository services](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/introducing-syntex-repository-services-microsoft-365-superpowers-for-your-app/). IT admins can manage access to Loop workspaces experiences using Cloud Policy.
### Exchange Online license

> Loop workspaces currently require each user to have an Exchange Online license and the user account ==can't be a resource account== (for example, a shared mailbox user). 
### WebSocket connections

> Loop's near real-time communications are enabled by the core services that run a ==WebSocket== server. Coauthors in the same session need to establish secured WebSocket connections to this service to send and receive collaborative data such as changes made by others, live cursors, presence, and so on. These experiences are crucial to Loop, and to all the scenarios powered by [[Fluid Framework]] framework. So, at the minimum, WebSocket needs to be unblocked from the user's endpoint.


##  2023-12 what's new

- General availability: Microsoft Loop is generally available for commercial customers on web and mobile!
- Table of contents: Insert a table of contents to view the headers of a page at a glance and quickly navigate to a specific section. To insert a table of contents, use the / menu.
- Markdown copy and paste: Copy Markdown text from wikis and markdown editors and the formatting will be reflected when you paste it into Loop.
- Duplicate page: Make a copy of a page so you can reuse the content. Select the page and chose Duplicate in the page options menu.
- Export to Excel: Now you can export your tabular content to Excel. Choose your table and select Export to Excel to dive into some detailed analysis.
- Planner component: Stay in sync across Planner and Loop with the Planner component. To try it, paste a link to your existing Planner plan into a Loop page.

## Good

- No copying/pasting of data which deters users from leaking data
- Components support actionability and live data so people can respond and get back to their high impact work
