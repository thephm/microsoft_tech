## Notes

- Creates a link to the file and uploads it to your personal OneDrive
	- `My Files > Loop > Workspace Uploads`
- File is not shared with the members of the workspace until they try to access it
	- When they do, they are added with `edit` permission
- When you delete a file in Loop, it only removes the link from Loop, not the file
- If you delete the file in OneDrive, the link stays in Loop and get an error when you try to access it
- Files up to 250 GB
- Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and PDF
