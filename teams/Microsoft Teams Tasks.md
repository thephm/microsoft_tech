# Microsoft Teams Tasks

## Quotes

> The Tasks app in Microsoft Teams brings together your individual tasks from To Do and Outlook with your team tasks from [[Microsoft Planner|Planner]] so you can more efficiently cross them off your lists. Use the unique List view to change many tasks at once, and easily find and edit them. Use the Tasks app to work on [[Microsoft To Do|ToDo]] and [[Microsoft Planner|Planner]] tasks alongside the [[Microsoft Teams|Teams]] channels, chats, and apps you're used to.
