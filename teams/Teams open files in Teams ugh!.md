# Teams open files in Teams ugh!

**Frustrating** by default when someone sends a file it opens it in the same Teams pane and you can't see other chats!

1. Click the three dots `...` just to left of your avatar/photo
2. Click `Settings`

3. Click `Files and links` 
4. Under "**File open preference**" click either `Desktop app` or `Browser`
