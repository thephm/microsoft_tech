# Hello World.

A practical guide to Microsoft Planner and Loop by someone implementing these tools with a team of 20 project managers. I will cut through confusing product changes to provide clear, experience-based insights.

This is a new site dedicated toÂ [Microsoft Planner](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/planner/microsoft-planner?ref=planner-ms.ghost.io)Â sprinkled with someÂ [Microsoft Loop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-loop?ref=planner-ms.ghost.io), the former I'm rolling out with a group of about 20 project managers at work.

### Why

Microsoft tech isÂ **really**Â confusing especially when the names of products are changed and this one is no exception. I'm finding it hard to get quick and up-to-date answers because Microsoft is actively developing and integrating this tool and still has the legacy tools lying around.
### What

I plan to use this platform to share my learnings and experiences in public and maybe you or someone you know can benefit and, in turn, I can learn from you.
### Who

Just me for now. I'm hoping others can join in over time, send me ideas, inspire me to continue.
### How

Through experiential learning, random acts of kindness from others, structured rollout of the tool, and sheer determination I intend to learn as much as I can to save people on my team the pain. Plus, if I can remove some friction and barriers to their learning, the rollout could go smoother.Â [Eat your own dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food?ref=planner-ms.ghost.io)!

### Get ready, get set...

So far I've done the following:

1. Looked back at my Obsidian notes on Planner and related files I took over the past year as inspiration
2. Took the course "[Introduction to Microsoft Project for the Web](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-microsoft-project-for-the-web-planner-premium/introduction-to-microsoft-project-for-the-web?u=87741562&ref=planner-ms.ghost.io)" by Cindy M. Lewis
3. Reading D. Lynn Kelly's bookÂ [Change Questions](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lynnkelleychange/?ref=planner-ms.ghost.io)Â and created a mini change management plan, signed up 5 early adopters, created a schedule for the change
4. Registered a domain name yesterday, coming soon!
5. Signed up forÂ [Ghost](https://ghost.io/?ref=planner-ms.ghost.io)Â this morning, which is such a great tool. I used it for my other hobbyÂ [noteapps.ca](https://www.noteapps.ca/?ref=planner-ms.ghost.io)
6. Found a good alias for myself and my privacy with the help of my friendÂ [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/?ref=planner-ms.ghost.io)Â ðŸ˜‚
7. Drafted a logo using Claude, he was so patient with me

### What's next

Well, it depends. It depends on how much time I can spend on this, how I can keep costs low, and maybe how many people are interested. That last part is not that important, I'll do it anyway ðŸ˜‚

Stay tuned!

Otto.
