# SharePoint Bunnies

> While watching American Idol with my wife one night this week, I drew this diagram to understand how and when SharePoint sites are created, wrt Teams. 
> 
> To create the diagram my stack is [Obsidian](https://www.linkedin.com/company/obsidianmd/) + [Excalidraw](https://www.linkedin.com/company/excalidraw/) plugin running on my Samsung S20 smartphone with DeX connected via an HDMI cable to a 24" Monitor. This is an amazing combo. 
> 
> As I was drawing, my wife asked if this was a make-work project to which I quickly replied "No, I need to understand this as it doesn't make sense to me and I need to understand why!". She said, "But it's Microsoft, you can't change it". I said "Yes, I can and I need to figure out how" ðŸ˜‚ 
> 
> From what I see, it's like bunnies, these SharePoint sites are popping up everywhere, all day, every day. And I know a lot about bunnies as I had ~ 200 rabbits when I was a teen. More context: this week I was about to go into a 1on1 in Teams and the person sent me a Teams message saying they would be late. BOOM, a SharePoint site was created with Files and all the other stuff that I didn't need or want. I was surprised and not in a good way. 
> 
> It also happens in many other single-instance meetings, which is bizarre to me. From what I can tell, there's a site-wide setting to disable this behaviour but I haven't figured out how to disable it for my specific meeting(s). If you know how, please pass it along! 
> 
> Anyhow, follow the steps/colours to see how SharePoint bunnies are born in MS365 and let me know of any corrections! 
> 
> Thanks, a newbie-Microsoft-Teams-SharePoint-user (I need a new alias for this new hobby!)
