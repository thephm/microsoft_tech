# How do I create an actual application running in Azure

Asked ChatGPT that

To create an application running in Azure, you can follow these general steps:

1. **Choose an [[Microsoft Azure|Azure]] Service**: Determine which Azure service(s) best fit your application's requirements, such as [[Azure App Service]] for web applications, [[Azure Functions]] for serverless computing, or [[Azure Virtual Machines]] for custom environments.

2. **Create a [[Resource Group]]**: Resource groups are containers that hold related resources for an Azure solution. Create a resource group to manage and organize your application's resources.

3. **Create and Configure the Azure Service**: Depending on your application's needs, create the appropriate Azure service(s) within your resource group. This may involve configuring settings such as pricing tiers, region, scalability options, and security settings.

4. **Develop and Deploy Your Application**: Develop your application code locally using your preferred development tools and frameworks. Once your application is ready, deploy it to the Azure service(s) you created. This typically involves uploading your application code, configuring settings, and deploying any necessary dependencies.

5. **Configure Networking and Security**: Ensure that your application's networking and security settings are properly configured to meet your requirements. This may include setting up virtual networks, configuring firewalls, enabling encryption, and managing access control.

6. **Monitor and Manage Your Application**: Use Azure monitoring and management tools to monitor the performance, availability, and health of your application. This includes setting up alerts, analyzing logs, and scaling resources as needed to meet demand.

7. **Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying your application code to Azure. This helps streamline the development and deployment process and ensures consistency and reliability.

By following these steps, you can create and deploy an application running in Azure. Keep in mind that the specific steps and tools may vary depending on the type of application you're building and the Azure services you're using.

## A [[TypeScript]] application 

To create and deploy a TypeScript application in Azure, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:
   - Install [[node.js]] and [[Node Package Manager|npm]] (Node Package Manager) if you haven't already
   - Install [[TypeScript]] globally: `npm install -g typescript`

2. **Initialize Your TypeScript Project**:
   - Create a new directory for your project
   - Inside the directory, run `npm init -y` to initialize a new npm package
   - Run `tsc --init` to generate a `tsconfig.json` file for TypeScript configuration

3. **Write Your TypeScript Code**:
   - Create your TypeScript files (e.g., `app.ts`)
   - Write your application code using TypeScript

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   - If your application has dependencies, install them using npm. For example: `npm install express @types/express`

5. **Compile TypeScript to JavaScript**:
   - Run `tsc` command in your project directory to compile TypeScript files into [[Javascript]]

6. **Create an [[Azure App Service]]**

   - Log in to the Azure Portal and navigate to the Azure App Service page.
   - Click on "Create" to create a new App Service.
   - Configure the settings for your App Service, including the runtime stack (Node.js), operating system, region, and pricing tier.

8. **Deploy Your Application**

   - There are several ways to deploy your application to Azure App Service:
     - Use [[Azure CLI]]: You can use the Azure CLI to deploy your application by running commands like `az webapp up --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group>`.
     - Use [[Microsoft Azure DevOps|Azure DevOps]]: Set up a CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps to automatically build and deploy your application to Azure.
     - Use [[Visual Studio Code]]: If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can deploy your application to Azure directly from the editor using extensions like Azure App Service.

9. **Configure Environment Variables** (Optional)

   - If your application requires environment variables, you can configure them in the [[Azure Portal]] or using [[Azure CLI]].

11. **Monitor and Manage Your Application**

   - Once your application is deployed, use Azure monitoring and management tools to monitor its performance, troubleshoot issues, and manage resources as needed.

## But I want to use GitHub Actions not Azure DevOps

Certainly! You can use [[GitHub Actions]] to set up a CI/CD pipeline for your TypeScript application and deploy it to [[Azure App Service]]. Here's a general outline of the steps involved:

1. **Set Up Your [[Technology/Development/git/Github|Github]] Repository**

   - Create a new repository on GitHub to host your TypeScript application
   - Push your TypeScript code to the repository

3. **Create [[GitHub Actions Workflow]]**

   - Inside your repository, create a `.github/workflows` directory
   - Create a YAML file (e.g., `ci-cd.yml`) within this directory to define your CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions

5. **Define Workflow Steps**

   - Define workflow steps to:
     - Install [[node.js]] and dependencies
     - Build your [[TypeScript]] code
     - Deploy the built code to [[Azure App Service]]

7. **Configure Secrets**

   - Store any sensitive information (e.g., Azure credentials) as secrets in your repository's settings. You'll use these secrets in your workflow to authenticate with Azure

9. **Trigger Workflow on Push or Pull Request**

   - Configure the workflow to trigger on pushes to specific branches or pull requests

11. **Run and Test the Workflow**

   - Commit and push your workflow file to your repository
   - GitHub Actions will automatically run your workflow based on the trigger conditions you've defined
   - Monitor the workflow execution and debug any issues that arise

13. **Verify Deployment**

   - Once the workflow completes successfully, verify that your TypeScript application is deployed and running on Azure App Service

15. **Monitor and Manage Your Application**

   - Use Azure monitoring and management tools to monitor the performance and health of your deployed application

By setting up a GitHub Actions workflow, you can automate the process of building and deploying your TypeScript application to Azure App Service directly from your GitHub repository. 

## How do I create a GitHub Actions Workflow?

To create a [[GitHub Actions]] workflow for your TypeScript application, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Your GitHub Repository**

   - Go to your GitHub repository where your TypeScript application is hosted.

3. **Create a `.github/workflows` Directory**

   - Inside your repository, create a new directory named `.github/workflows`. You can do this directly in your repository using GitHub's web interface.

5. **Create a Workflow [YAML](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/yaml-syntax-for-github-actions) File**

   - Inside the `.github/workflows` directory, create a new YAML file. You can name it anything you like, such as `ci-cd.yml`.

7. **Define Workflow Syntax**

   - Open the YAML file and define the [syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) for your workflow. This includes specifying the name, trigger events, jobs, and steps.

9. **Define Jobs and Steps**

   - Define one or more jobs for your workflow, such as `build` and `deploy`.
   - Inside each job, define the steps required to complete the job. This may include setting up the environment, installing dependencies, building the TypeScript code, and deploying to Azure App Service.

11. **Configure Secrets** (if needed)

   - If your workflow requires sensitive information such as credentials or API keys, configure them as secrets in your repository's settings. You can then use these secrets in your workflow to authenticate with Azure or other services.

13. **Commit and Push Changes**

   - Once you've defined your workflow, commit the changes to your repository and push them to GitHub.

15. **Verify Workflow Execution**

   - GitHub Actions will automatically detect the new workflow file and start executing it based on the trigger events you've defined.
   - Monitor the workflow execution in the Actions tab of your repository to ensure it runs successfully.

17. **Debug and Iterate**

   - If any issues arise during workflow execution, debug them by examining the workflow logs and making necessary adjustments to your workflow file.
   - Iterate on your workflow as needed to improve performance, reliability, and maintainability.

By following these steps, you can create a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the [[CI/CD]] process for your TypeScript application, including building and deploying to Azure App Service.
