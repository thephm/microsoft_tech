- Summary: SharePoint's REST service allows remote interaction with SharePoint data using any technology supporting REST web requests, enabling CRUD operations from SharePoint Add-ins and client applications. Developers need basic REST knowledge to construct RESTful HTTP requests for accessing SharePoint resources. The service handles requests through the client.svc web service, providing responses in Atom or JSON formats. Different HTTP commands correspond to CRUD operations for interacting with SharePoint entities like lists and sites through REST endpoints.

- developers can perform **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** (CRUD) operations from their SharePoint Add-ins, solutions, and client applications, using REST web technologies and standard Open Data Protocol (OData) syntax.
- The endpoints in the SharePoint REST service correspond to the types and members in the SharePoint client object models. By using HTTP requests, you can use these REST endpoints to do typical CRUD operations against SharePoint entities, such as lists and sites.
