This question is asking about the difference between Power Apps and Power Platform, and their relation to Dataverse. These are Microsoft products in their business application ecosystem. Let me provide a clear explanation of each and how they relate to each other.

Power Platform is the broader ecosystem, which includes several products:

1. Power Apps
2. Power Automate (formerly Flow)
3. Power BI
4. Power Virtual Agents
5. Power Pages (formerly Power Apps portals)

Power Apps is one component of the Power Platform that specifically focuses on building low-code/no-code applications.

Dataverse (formerly known as Common Data Service or CDS) is essentially the data storage and management backbone that all these Power Platform components can utilize.

I'll structure my response to clearly explain:

1. What Power Platform is
2. What Power Apps is specifically
3. What Dataverse is
4. How they all relate to each other

I'll keep my response concise and focused on the key information the person needs to understand these technologies.
# Power Apps vs Power Platform vs Dataverse

Power Apps and Power Platform are related but different Microsoft technologies, with [[Dataverse]] serving as their underlying data foundation. Here's how they relate:
## Power Platform

[[Power Platform]] is Microsoft's comprehensive suite of low-code development and business intelligence tools that includes:

- Power Apps
- Power Automate (for workflow automation)
- Power BI (for data analytics and visualization)
- Power Virtual Agents (for chatbots)
- Power Pages (for external-facing websites)
## Power Apps

Power Apps is a specific component within the Power Platform that focuses on building custom business applications with minimal coding. It includes:
- Canvas apps (highly customizable, pixel-perfect UI control)
- Model-driven apps (data-centric applications built on top of Dataverse)
- Portal apps (external-facing websites)
## Dataverse

Dataverse (formerly Common Data Service) is the unified data storage and management service that powers the entire Power Platform. It provides:

- Structured data storage with pre-built data models
- Built-in security and governance
- Business logic and validation capabilities
- Integration with the broader Microsoft ecosystem

Think of Power Platform as the entire toolkit, Power Apps as one specific tool for building applications, and Dataverse as the foundation that stores and manages all your business data across the platform.
