> Hi Mark, thanks for accepting my connection request. I enjoyed the AMA and spent (too many) hours collating all the feedback and grouping it by topic. Hope it helps your team but likely you have that already figured out! https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/planner/collated-notes-from-new-planner-ama/m-p/4108557/highlight/true#M6413

> Thanks, Otto. I looped in a few of the Planner team members as a new comment on my related LinkedIn post, shared your PDF'linked comment and at-mentioned you as well so you'll see it.
