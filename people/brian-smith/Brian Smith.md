# Brian Smith

## Bio

> Retired, unless you have something really interesting that you think I might like to do...

> I am an escalation engineer working on Microsoft Planner and Project in all its variations. I run the Project Support blogs at https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/project-support-blog/bg-p/ProjectSupport and the Planner and Project blogs at TechCommunity. My route to technology came via research photographic chemistry transitioning to the implementation of ERP systems - going through UNIX to Windows along the way. Outside of work I'm interested in photography and getting into 3d software - hence my @briansmith.photos Instagram handle.
