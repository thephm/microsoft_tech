# Microsoft Sharepoint

[[Sharepoint Online]] vs. Sharepoint Server (on-prem)

[[OneDrive for Business]] ([[OD4B]])

## Quotes


> SharePoint is based around individual sites, which can contain different subsites and elements similar to a normal website, but with access limited to a pre-defined group of users. This can include members of your organization as well as external partners, contractors, freelancers or guests. Access to SharePoint Online is managed through group membership in Azure Active Directory, Microsoft’s cloud-based directory service. - [1]

> SharePoint acts as the foundation for file sharing in Microsoft 365 - [1]

> serves as the technical basis for both Teams and OneDrive - [1]

> OneDrive basically acts as a SharePoint site that only one person can access by default. Files and folders are stored as objects or subsites within the site and when you share a OneDrive file with another user, you provide them access to that specific part of your personal SharePoint. - [1]

> each new [Teams] channel starts with two essential tabs: a message board and a library of shared files. These basic tabs can’t be deleted

> Behind the scenes, Teams uses SharePoint for most of its features. The individual teams users can join are modeled as SharePoint sites, which store elements like different tabs, attachments, shared documents, etc. With one important exception: Files shared in Teams chats are stored in OneDrive [for Business]. - [1] 

> If you’re working on a file by yourself, save it to OneDrive. Your OneDrive files are private unless you share them with others, which is particularly useful if you haven’t created a team yet.
> 
> If you’re already working as a team — in Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, or Outlook—you should save your files where your team works, because OneDrive for work or school connects you to all your shared libraries, too.
> 
> When you need a new shared location to store team files, create a shared library right from OneDrive, add members, and start working together. These libraries are accessible within Teams, SharePoint, and Outlook. And it’s easy to copy or move files where you and others need them.
> - [2]

> Behind the scenes, SharePoint in Microsoft 365 provides the content services for all files in Microsoft 365, including files you work with in Teams, Yammer, and Outlook. SharePoint is always there, helping manage and protect your files, and powering content collaboration across Microsoft 365. And beyond files, SharePoint enables portals, news, pages, lists, and a platform for business apps. - [2]

> There are a few issues to keep in mind when moving documents from OneDrive and a shared library:
> 
> The steps for copying or moving files can vary between versions of OneDrive and SharePoint. For more info, see Move or copy files in SharePoint.
> 
> Hyperlinks to the original document stop working, because you’ve deleted the document in OneDrive. You may want to share the document you moved to the team site to give people on the site an updated, working link.
> 
> If people followed the original document, links in their newsfeed to that document will stop working. To restore this association, people will need to follow the document in its new location.
> 
> You might want to replace the original document in OneDrive with one that simply gives a link to the new file, and announces the new location.
> - [2]

> each [OneDrive for Business site is a single SharePoint online site collection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/onedrive-for-business-customization-sharepoint-add-in) that is only accessible by an individual user. Which is why OneDrive for Business URLs follow this format- https://domain-my.sharepoint.com/personal/accountname_domain_com/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx, based on certain SharePoint-provided standards.

> Any document shared in [Teams 1:1 chats or groups is then accessible by individual users in their OneDrive storage](https://www.syscloud.com/saas-data-protection-center/microsoft-365/teams-data-storage/)
> - [3]

> Any document shared in a Teams channel gets automatically stored in the Teams SharePoint Site remains accessible to all the Team members.
