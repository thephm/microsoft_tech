Why do I need a client id and secret in azure

> In [[Azure]], a client ID and secret are used for authentication and authorization purposes. The client ID identifies your application, while the secret acts as a password to authenticate the application. This ensures secure access to Azure resources and services, protecting your data and maintaining control over who can access your resources.

When are they used?

> The client ID and secret are typically used when your application needs to authenticate itself to access Azure resources or services programmatically, such as through APIs or SDKs. They are exchanged during the authentication process to verify the identity of your application and grant it the necessary permissions to access the requested resources.

Are they for managing Azure resources or accessing AD?

> The client ID and secret in Azure are primarily used for accessing Azure resources rather than managing them directly. However, they are also commonly used for accessing Azure Active Directory (AD) resources, as Azure AD is often used for authentication and authorization in Azure environments. So, while they are not for directly managing Azure resources, they play a crucial role in accessing and interacting with them securely.

## From [1]

- Client IDs and Client Secrets are different than a Tenant ID
- Set up an App Registration which automatically generates a `Client ID` and enables you to  generate an associated `Client Secret`
- Then add the permission scopes needed to the associated **managed identity** to carry out the tasks you need

To obtain `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`:

1. Create an **Azure Active Directory Application** in Microsoft Entra ID:
    - In Azure portal navigate to `MS EntraID`
    - Click  `App registrations` 
    - Then `New registration`
    - Once the application is created, note down the Application (client) ID. This is your `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
2. Generate a **Client Secret**
    - In application settings, go to `Certificates & secrets`. Under  `Client secrets`, click `new client secret`.
- the generated client secret is your `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`

`AuthorizationFailed` indicates that the App Registration doesn't have permissions to perform the action, trying to start a VM, it lacks authorization. To resolve, ensure the `App Registration` has the appropriate permissions by assigning the `Contributor` role
