# Azure API Management

Azure API Management (APIM) is a fully managed service that enables customers to publish, secure, transform, maintain, and monitor APIs. It's designed to provide organizations with everything they need to operationalize APIs and monitor their usage and health. Here are some of the key features of Azure API Management:​

- API Gateway: Serves as a reverse proxy, accepting API calls and routing them to the appropriate backend services after applying the necessary policies. It handles all the requests and responses between users and your backend services.​
    
- Security: Includes built-in security protocols to protect your APIs. Security features include keys, tokens, IP filtering, and the use of Azure Active Directory. It supports OAuth 2.0 for API authentication and authorization.​
    
- Rate Limiting and Quotas: Controls the rate at which API consumers can call the API to prevent abuse and overuse. This ensures that the APIs are used in a controlled way and helps in managing the overall health of the API applications.​
    
- Caching: Improves request latency and reduces backend load by caching API responses. The cache can be configured per API or per operation.​
    
- Analytics and Monitoring: Provides insights through analytics dashboards on APIs’ usage, performance, and health. Integration with Azure Monitor and Azure Application Insights allows for detailed monitoring, custom alerts, and diagnostics.​
    
- Policies: Allows setting of policies to transform, control, and restrict how the APIs are consumed, including rewriting URLs, limiting the size of payloads, and transforming formats from XML to JSON, among others.​
    
- Versioning and Revision Control: Supports API versioning which helps in managing multiple versions of an API and provides version deprecation capabilities. Revisions allow API publishers to make changes to APIs in a controlled manner without affecting the consumers.​
    
- API Design and Mocking: APIM includes features for API design and mocking, enabling API publishers to design APIs and simulate API behavior before actual implementation. This helps in prototyping and testing.​
    
- Multi-Region Deployment: Supports deploying API Management instances in multiple geographical regions to achieve high availability and reduce latency for consumers distributed globally.​
    
- Custom Domain and SSL: Supports the use of custom domains with managed SSL certificates or bring-your-own-certificates to maintain brand consistency and security.​
    
- Integration with Azure Services: Seamless integration with other Azure services such as Azure Logic Apps, Azure Functions, and Azure Service Bus enhances the capability to create comprehensive, serverless, backend solutions for APIs.​
