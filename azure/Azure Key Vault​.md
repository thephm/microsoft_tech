# Azure Key Vault​

- Centralized Secret Management: Key Vault allows organizations to securely store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets.​
    
- Encryption Key Management: It provides a secure location to store and manage encryption keys. These keys are protected by hardware security modules (HSMs) - specialized physical devices designed to safeguard digital keys and perform cryptographic operations.​
    
- Secure Access: Key Vault is designed to ensure that neither Microsoft nor any Azure service can see or extract the keys. Access to the Key Vault requires proper authentication and authorization.​
    
- Access Policies: Fine-grained access policies can be applied to control who can access what information and operations within the Key Vault, including creation, deletion, and modification of keys and secrets.​
    
- Audit Trails: Key Vault offers in-depth monitoring and logging capabilities, which provide an audit trail of who accessed the key vault and what operations they performed. This is critical for compliance and forensic analysis.​
    
- Automated Key Rotation: Key Vault can automate the process of key rotation, helping to meet security best practices without requiring manual effort, reducing the risk associated with human error.​
    
- Integration with Other Azure Services: Key Vault integrates seamlessly with other Azure services. For instance, you can use it to manage keys for Azure Disk Encryption, SQL Database Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), and Azure Information Protection.​
    
- HSM-backed Keys: It offers the option to use keys that are safeguarded within FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated HSMs, providing enhanced protection for handling highly sensitive data.​
    
- Support for Multiple Key Types: Key Vault supports RSA and elliptic curve cryptographic keys, which are commonly used for encrypting data and creating digital signatures.​
    
- Application Secrets Management: Developers can use Key Vault to control application secrets without storing them in their code, providing an additional layer of security by segregating duties within the application architecture.​
    
- Certificate Management: Key Vault can manage SSL/TLS certificates, providing a streamlined process for certificate creation, management, and renewal.Regulatory Compliance: It helps in complying with industry standards and regulations, such as HIPAA, ISO, SOC, and PCI DSS, by providing secure and compliant management of cryptographic keys and secrets.​
