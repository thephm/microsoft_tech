## Notes

-  The [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) lets you easily manage all your Azure services. You can also manage your services programmatically by using service-specific APIs and templates.

- Provides Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to give you full control over your application hosting. Azure's Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings provide the fully managed services needed to power your apps. There's even true serverless hosting in Azure where all you need to do is write your code.
