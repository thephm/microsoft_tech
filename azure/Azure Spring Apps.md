## Notes

Azure Spring Apps is a ==serverless app platform== that enables you to build, deploy, scale and monitor your ==Java Spring middleware== applications in the cloud. Use Spring Cloud to bring modern microservice patterns to Spring Boot apps, eliminating boilerplate code to quickly build robust Java Spring middleware apps.

- Leverage managed versions of Spring Cloud Service Discovery and Config Server, while we ensure those critical components are running in optimum conditions.
- Focus on building your business logic and we will take care of your service runtime with security patches, compliance standards and high availability.
- Manage application lifecycle (for example, deploy, start, stop, scale) on top of Azure Kubernetes Service.
- Easily bind connections between your apps and Azure services such as Azure Database for MySQL and Azure Cache for Redis.
- Monitor and troubleshoot applications using enterprise-grade unified monitoring tools that offer deep insights on application dependencies and operational telemetry.

> **When to use:** As a fully managed service Azure Spring Apps is a good choice when you're minimizing operational cost running Spring Boot and Spring Cloud apps on Azure.
