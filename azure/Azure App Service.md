Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps. Here are some of the top advantages of using Azure App Service:​

- Integrated Environment: Azure App Service provides an integrated environment for developing, testing, and deploying web applications and APIs, making the development process smoother and more efficient.​
    
- Multiple Languages and Frameworks: The service supports a wide range of programming languages such as .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, and Python, allowing developers to work in the language they are most familiar with.​
    
- Scalability: Azure App Service allows for easy scaling of applications either automatically or manually, ensuring that your application can handle changes in load without any downtime.​
    
- High Availability: Built to deliver high availability with a 99.95% SLA, Azure App Service includes automatic OS and platform patching and maintenance, freeing up developer time to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure management.​
    
- Security: Azure App Service provides built-in security and compliance features, including support for Azure Active Directory and integration with Microsoft’s security offerings to protect applications against threats.​
    
- Integrated DevOps Capabilities: The platform supports continuous integration and deployment using Azure DevOps, GitHub, Bitbucket, or any Git repo, enabling a streamlined workflow from source code to production.​
    
- Global Reach with Geo-Distribution: Azure App Service allows you to run your applications in data centers located around the world, enabling you to provide better response times to your users no matter where they are located.​
    
- Connection to On-premises or Other Cloud Services: Azure App Service offers hybrid connectivity options such as VPNs and Azure ExpressRoute, enabling secure access to on-premises databases or other cloud services.​
    
- Managed Database Services: It can seamlessly integrate with Azure SQL Database, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and other Azure services, providing high-performance database services managed by Microsoft.​
    
- Custom Domain and SSL: You can easily configure custom domains and secure your applications with SSL/TLS certificates, which Azure can manage automatically.​
    

> When you want the quickest path to publish your web-based projects, consider Azure App Service. App Service makes it easy to extend your web apps to support your mobile clients and publish easily consumed REST APIs. This platform provides authentication by using social providers, traffic-based autoscaling, testing in production, and continuous and container-based deployments.
> 
> You can create web apps, mobile app back ends, and API apps. Develop in your favorite language, including .NET, .NET Core, Java, Node.js, PHP, and Python. Applications run and scale with ease on both Windows and Linux-based environments.
> 
> Because all three app types share the ==App Service runtime==, you can host a website, support mobile clients, and expose your APIs in Azure, all from the same project or solution. To learn more about App Service, see [What is Azure Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview).
> 
> App Service has been designed with DevOps in mind. It supports various tools for publishing and continuous integration deployments. These tools include GitHub webhooks, Jenkins, Azure DevOps, TeamCity, and others.
> 
> You can migrate your existing applications to App Service by using the [online migration tool](https://appmigration.microsoft.com/).
> 
> **When to use**: Use App Service when you're migrating existing web applications to Azure, and when you need a ==fully-managed hosting platform for your web apps==. You can also use App Service when you need to support mobile clients or expose REST APIs with your app.
> 
> **Get started**: App Service makes it easy to create and deploy your first [web app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-dotnetcore), [mobile app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/azure/app-service-mobile/app-service-mobile-ios-get-started), or [API app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-rest-api).
