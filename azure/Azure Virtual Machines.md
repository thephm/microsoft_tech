## Notes

As an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider, [[Microsoft Azure|Azure]] lets you deploy to or migrate your application to either Windows or Linux VMs. Together with Azure Virtual Network, Azure Virtual Machines supports the deployment of Windows or Linux VMs to Azure. With VMs, you have total control over the configuration of the machine. When using VMs, you're responsible for all server software installation, configuration, maintenance, and operating system patches.

Because of the level of control that you have with VMs, you can run a wide range of server workloads on Azure that don't fit into a PaaS model. These workloads include database servers, Windows Server Active Directory, and Microsoft SharePoint. For more information, see the Virtual Machines documentation for either [Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/) or [Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/).

> **When to use**: Use Virtual Machines when you want full control over your application infrastructure or to migrate on-premises application workloads to Azure without having to make changes.
> 
> **Get started**: Create a [Linux VM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal) or [Windows VM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal) from the Azure portal.
