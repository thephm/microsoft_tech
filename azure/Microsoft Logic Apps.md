# Microsoft Logic Apps

[[Microsoft Logic Apps]] is a cloud-based service within [[Azure]] that helps you schedule, automate, and orchestrate tasks, business processes, and workflows when you need to integrate apps, data, systems, and services across enterprises or organizations. Logic Apps simplifies how you design and build scalable solutions for app integration, data integration, system integration, enterprise application integration (EAI), and business-to-business (B2B) communication, whether in the cloud, on-premises, or both.​

Key Features of [[Logic Apps]]:​

- Workflow Automation: Create and run workflows that can integrate different systems and services, such as sending an email, manipulating data, or even calling long-running processes.​
- Connectors: Comes with a vast library of connectors to various services and systems like SQL, [[Azure Service Bus]], HTTP, FTP, and more, including popular third-party systems like Salesforce, Google Services, and Twitter.​
- Visual Designer: Offers a visual designer that can be used directly from the Azure portal, allowing users to design workflows by dragging and dropping elements without the need to write code.​
- Triggers and Actions: Workflows in Logic Apps are triggered by specific events (like receiving an email in Outlook) and then proceed through a series of steps or actions based on the application logic.​
