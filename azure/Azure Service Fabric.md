## Notes

Azure Service Fabric is a ==distributed systems platform==. This platform makes it easy to build, package, deploy, and manage scalable and reliable microservices. It also provides comprehensive application management capabilities such as:

- Provisioning
- Deploying
- Monitoring
- Upgrading/Patching
- Deleting

Apps, which run on a shared pool of machines, can start small and scale to hundreds or thousands of machines as needed.

Service Fabric supports WebAPI with [[Open Web Interface]] for .NET ([[Open Web Interface for .NET|OWIN]]) and [[ASP.NET Core]]. It provides SDKs for building services on Linux in both .NET Core and Java. To learn more about Service Fabric, see the [Service Fabric documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/).

> **When to use:** Service Fabric is a good choice when you're creating an application or rewriting an existing application to use a microservice architecture. Use Service Fabric when you need more control over, or direct access to, the underlying infrastructure.
