# Create a List Across Microsoft 365

URL: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sharepoint-blog/create-a-list-across-microsoft-365/ba-p/3730138

## One | Create a list using the Microsoft Lists app itself

> The Microsoft 365 app launcher is where it’s at – figuratively and technically. Click the app launcher icon (the upper-left square of nine dots, often referred to as the hamburger). Once clicked, you’ll see all your Microsoft 365 apps – ready to launch – including the beautiful, multicolored Lists app (it looks like yellow, orange, red and purple stacked books

## Two | Create a list from the Microsoft 365 app – across commercial and consumer

> For this one, let’s jump you right into the Create experience within the Microsoft 365 app – type Microsoft365.com/create into your browser; I’ll meet you there. And FYI, this is what is replacing Office.com (which still works) and is also being referred to as Microsoft 365 app going forward.
> 
> Once on Microsoft365.com, click the **+ Create** button in the upper left side of the screen (for work and school (first graphic below - AAD) AND home and personal (second graphic below – MSA)). Here you’ll find the Create > **List** (alongside various other Microsoft 365 app templates) that takes you directly into the Lists app to create a list, right into the common create list experience.
> 
> The main Create page when signed into Microsoft365.com with your work or school ID (AAD). Note: Lists is now one of the main content types to create from the top carousel.

##  Three | Create a list from the SharePoint app bar

> The SharePoint app bar makes important content and resources easier to find no matter where you are in SharePoint. You'll find it on the left-hand side anywhere in modern sites (team sites, communication sites, hub sites, and home sites. Use it to get to your content, listed as: My sites, My news, My files, and My lists – all personalized and powered by Microsoft Graph. And below all these site and content pivots appears the new + Create experience – to create sites, files, and lists. (View Highlight)

## Four | Create a list in SharePoint itself – within team sites, communication sites, hub sites, and home sites

> This is where it all started for lists – *listerally* – as SharePoint lists (intentionally lower case ‘l’). And as we evolved lists into Microsoft Lists (note the capital “L”), we [carried forward the value of SharePoint](https://aka.ms/MSLists/blog/SharePoint) (including the lists themselves) and added loads of new capabilities in use in Lists today.

## Five | Create a list in Microsoft Teams

>   The vision of the **Lists app in Teams** is to bring all the collaboration and communication modalities to lists and list items, so it is easy to get work done.
>   
>   To get started, simply go to any channel where you would like to start tracking a list and hit the “+” *Add a tab* button to explore the tab gallery and select the **Lists app**. Once the tab is added you can either create a new list or bring in an existing list (from another team or an older SharePoint site, but not a personal list) into the channel as a new tab.

## Six | Create a list from the Microsoft Lists app for iOS and Android

> The Lists mobile apps help you work with your lists on the go – on both iOS and Android. Beyond viewing and editing existing lists and list items, you can create new lists… while sipping coffee - create an Issue tracker list, or when in the passenger’s seat headed to a work event – create a blank list to capture all your new people contacts. No matter the out-and-about scenario, work and information management doesn’t have to stop when you’re on the go.

## BONUS | Create a list while using a Microsoft 365 connected template

> We are combining the best of **Microsoft Teams templates with SharePoint site templates** – into the same flow of creation. When we create a new team using a default template – for example the “Manage a Project” template, the project management channels and apps, and the connected SharePoint template get applied automatically. And the SharePoint pages, lists, and Power Platform integrations that get created in the new, same SharePoint site. Once it finishes, you’ll see all pinned as tabs in Teams automatically. And best of all these pages and lists are fully editable right in Teams.

>   When users create a team using the template – above shows the “Manage a Project” template - the connected SharePoint template is applied to the site and the team. SharePoint components such as pages, lists (note the Issue Tracker and Project Tracker lists), and Power Platform integrations are automatically added and pinned as tabs to the General channel in the team.

>   Microsoft 365 connected templates save you time and highlight the art of the possible as content and collaboration blend in the flow of your collaborative work management.
