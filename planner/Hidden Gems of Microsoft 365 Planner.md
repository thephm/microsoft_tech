- visual collaboration and Kanban planning software 
- can be used as a standalone app or as part of the larger integrated Microsoft task experience
- What is the Microsoft Task Ecosystem?
- [[Microsoft Planner]] is built on flexibility with not just a traditional task board view but also charts and a schedule view
- Plannerâ€™s goal is to help you visualise your tasks, reduce work in progress, and boost productivity 
- create and save templates for recurring tasks
- Connect Forms to Planner with [[Projects/RPA/Power Automate]] and automatically generate tasks for your Team from information collected in that Form
- Outlook and Teams become hubs for task activity, whilst tasks can also easily be assigned from Word, Excel and PowerPoint
- Planner offers 3 task views, Board, Charts and Schedule each offer a different way to visualise a projects task:
	   - Board view is where you can effortlessly create tasks and move them between buckets just like you would on a Kanban board or Scrum.
	  - Charts give you a visual representation of your progress in the form of pie and bar charts.
	  - Schedule lets you see an overview of your project tasks in a traditional monthly calendar view.
- tasks are assigned with a simple @ mention from within the comments area of a document
