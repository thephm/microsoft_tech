## Guests

see [7]

> **Note:** Planner email notifications for task assignments are not supported for guest users.

> Planner builds on the Microsoft 365 groups guest access feature. If Microsoft 365 Groups guest access is turned off, you won't be able to add guest users to plans. For more information, see [Guest access in Microsoft 365 groups](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/adding-guests-to-microsoft-365-groups-bfc7a840-868f-4fd6-a390-f347bf51aff6). - [7]

1. A group owner [adds a guest to the group](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-and-remove-group-members-in-outlook-3b650f4a-5c9b-4f94-a1bb-0cca4b1091de#BKMK_Guests). 
    **Note:** To find the group associated with a plan, go to outlook.com, and in the **Folders** pane scroll down to the **Groups** folder and find your plan name.
2. Guest gets a welcome email from the group. If they do not already have a guest account with the organization, they need to accept this invitation to create one. In the welcome email, under **Read group files**, select the **Access files** link and following the instructions to create a guest account.
3. To access a plan, guests either need to use a specific plan URL or go to https://tasks.office.com/[organizationdomainname]. You can find the organization's domain name in any non-guest user's email address; for example: nonguestuser@organizationdomainname.com. The general Planner URL, https://tasks.office.com/, takes non-guest Microsoft 365 users to Planner, but won't know from the guest user name which organization they want to sign in to.
4. The guest can leave the plan at any time using a link at the bottom of each email and calendar invitations.
