# Tasks by Planner

**"Tasks by Planner"** is the **Teams app for [[Microsoft Planner]] and [[Microsoft To Do]]**. It integrates both task management tools into Microsoft Teams, allowing users to manage **individual and team tasks** in a single place.

### Key Features

- **Collaborate in Teams** – Discuss tasks directly within Teams channels.  
- **Notifications & reminders** – Stay on top of deadlines with alerts.

### How It Works

- **For team-based tasks:** Uses **Microsoft Planner**, which organizes tasks into **buckets** and **boards**.
    
- **For personal tasks:** Uses **Microsoft To Do**, showing personal task lists.

### Where to Find It?

- In **[[Microsoft Teams]]**, go to **Apps > Tasks by Planner and To Do**.
    
- Accessible from the **left-side Teams menu** or within a **Teams channel tab**.
