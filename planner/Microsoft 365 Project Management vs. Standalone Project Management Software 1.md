- By Project Management Software, I imply [**dedicated Software As a Service (SaaS) web-based application**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_software) companies would use specifically for Project Management. The following would be the elements typically found in such applications:
  • Task Management
  • Document Management
  • Chat capabilities
  • Resource Management
  • Budget Management
  • Risk Management
  • Issue Management
  • Project Status Reporting capabilities
  Examples of project management software include some household names like [**Asana**](https://asana.com/), [**ClickUp**](https://clickup.com/), [**Wrike**](https://www.wrike.com/), [**Smartsheet**](https://www.smartsheet.com/), [**Monday.com**](https://monday.com/), and some lesser-known and industry-specific project management software.
- Microsoft 365 relies on [**SharePoint for document management**](https://sharepointmaven.com/what-is-sharepoint-and-what-is-it-used-for/), you are in good hands with having a good DMS for your project documents. By default, you get all the bells and whistles that come out of the box. And these are true and amazing features that are priceless when managing projects: [**Version History**](https://sharepointmaven.com/major-vs-minor-versions-in-sharepoint-online/), [**Check In/Check Out**](https://sharepointmaven.com/do-you-really-need-to-check-out-a-document-in-sharepoint/), and [**co-authoring**](https://sharepointmaven.com/co-authoring-documents-in-sharepoint/) 
- Integration of task management tools with Teams
- The ability to merge Planner Tasks with personal [**To Do**](https://sharepointmaven.com/what-is-microsoft-to-do/) tasks and bring all of these together within Teams is [**truly amazing**](https://sharepointmaven.com/microsoft-planner-best-practices/).
- Disadvantages of using Microsoft 365 for project managementContent all over the place
- Documents will reside in SharePoint and OneDrive, tasks will be organized in [**Planner or Project for the Web**](https://sharepointmaven.com/an-overview-of-task-management-options-in-sharepoint-and-office-365/), issues logs and risk registers will be created in [**Lists**](https://sharepointmaven.com/what-are-microsoft-lists/), and conversations will be stored in [**Teams channels**](https://sharepointmaven.com/3-types-of-conversations-and-file-management-in-ms-teams/). So you will need to ensure all these elements will be properly managed, retained, and administered and that none are accidentally removed or deleted.

- Lack of project management-specific templates and artifacts
  Since Microsoft 365 is not a dedicated Project Management application and is used in various use cases, it does not have many project management-specific templates and artifacts. There is a Teams template in Teams and a custom site design for a project site, but everything else must be manually created.
- if you are a project manager and need to quickly get a dashboard on the state of a project or multiple projects – you would need to manually configure proper reports/dashboards in [**Power BI**](https://sharepointmaven.com/what-is-powerbi/).

- Too many choices for one use case
  Another issue with Microsoft 365 is that it suffers from the **“What to use when”** syndrome. There are many tools within Microsoft 365 that kind of do the same thing, and before you embark on a project management journey, you first have to set standards and common apps to use within your organization/project management office (PMO). For example, we have [**Planner and Project for the Web**](https://sharepointmaven.com/an-overview-of-task-management-options-in-sharepoint-and-office-365/), and some would argue [**Lists**](https://sharepointmaven.com/lists-or-planner/) – which could all be used for project management. Likewise, we have [**Teams and Yammer**](https://sharepointmaven.com/teams-vs-yammer/) as well. I compare various task tools available within Microsoft 365 in [**this article**](https://sharepointmaven.com/an-overview-of-task-management-options-in-sharepoint-and-office-365/).
- Integration between Teams and 3rd party Project Management Software
  If you are debating on whether to stay with your current project management software or switch entirely to the Microsoft 365 set of applications, this feature I am about to describe will definitely impact your decision. Most well-known project management software like Asana, ClickUp, Monday.com, Wrike, Smartsheet, etc., have integration with Microsoft Teams, where you can add those applications as tabs in Teams channels and essentially associate projects you already manage elsewhere with Teams/Microsoft 365 Groups. This option is great if you have already set up some rules, workflows, templates, and methodology in the PM software and just want to enhance collaboration by adding the power of Microsoft Teams.
