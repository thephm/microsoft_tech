> Some plans in Planner aren't attached to a Microsoft 365 group. These plans are used when it would be cumbersome to add another group, and when the plan is temporary, for example when you create a plan from a [task list in meeting notes](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/manage-your-tasks-from-loop-task-lists-and-collaborative-notes-in-planner-and-to-do-94383070-5f2f-4954-8607-7b7ebff5d43e).
> 
> Because these plans aren't attached to a Microsoft 365 group: 
> 
> - There is no owner. Any member can add or remove other members and edit or delete the plan.
> - There is no associated OneNote or SharePoint site.
> - You can't comment on tasks.
> - You can't upload attachments.
> - When the last member leaves the plan, the plan is automatically deleted.
> 
> Otherwise, you can use these plans to track and assign tasks as usual in Planner. View an [overview of Microsoft Planner](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sign-in-to-microsoft-planner-fe43c972-5a95-4071-86d4-423a64a3b21e).
