Meet the new [[Microsoft Planner]]. We’re bringing together the simplicity of [[Microsoft To Do]], the collaboration of Microsoft Planner, the power of [[Microsoft Project for the web]] and the intelligence of [[First interaction with CoPilot]] into a simple, familiar experience. The new Planner will easily scale from simple task management to enterprise project management, empowering everyone to manage their work in one place and accelerate business outcomes. End users can simply use natural language to create project plans, sprints, etc.  It also integrates with Microsoft Viva Goals, connecting to organizations' objectives and key results (OKR) to inform plans and provide high-level visibility.
  
Rollout timeline for the new Planner:   
  
- Spring 2024: The new Planner app in Teams will be generally available (the current Tasks by Planner and To Do app in Teams will be renamed to Planner). Microsoft Project for the web will be renamed to Planner.   
  
- Later in 2024: The web experience of the new Planner will be generally available. The features you know and love in Microsoft Project for the web will be available in the new Planner app in Teams and the Planner web app.
