- use `<Insert>` key to add task or right click

- use days or weeks for durations because "months" uses the average number of days a month
- zero (`0d`) tasks are milestones
- add the "`Outline number`" column to see the task level

- Termed 'Depends on' instead of 'Predecessor' and 'Dependents' instead of 'Successor' 
- Drag and drop dependencies in Timeline view - more fun but tricky to use
