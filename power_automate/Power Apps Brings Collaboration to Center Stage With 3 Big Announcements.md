- **Cards for Power Apps** are a completely new way to design and deliver mini-apps directly inside Microsoft Teams and Outlook using low code.
- **Coauthoring** is coming to Power Apps as well, using the same realtime collab capabilities that millions of people are using in Office 365. This is a big step forward for software development, allowing multiple makers to collaboratively build and edit the same app simultaneously
- Cards for Power Apps
  Cards for Power Apps is a new addition to the low code lineup, allowing business users and developers alike to build visual, interactive, data-driven, and actionable cards. These embeddable micro-apps can be shared with other people in Teams and Outlook with a customizable visual interface.
- Cards for Power Apps is based on the popular [Adaptive Card framework](https://adaptivecards.io/), used by professional developers to serve millions of users with pre-built actionable cards today. By bringing this capability to low code, we’re dramatically broadening who can build and deliver lightweight, embedded experiences.
- The Power Platform Connectors in the card designer will allow users to connect to enterprise data and back-end services safely and securely, filling the card with relevant data when a user sees it in Teams. Of course, Microsoft Dataverse is built right in as well, making it possible to easily build lightweight cards backed by a powerful enterprise data platform.
  
- Cards use all the familiar tools of Power Apps, including connectors and Power Fx 
- **Add business logic with Power Fx**
  Support for Power Fx – the open-source low code programming language based on Excel – makes fast inline calculations and dynamic actions possible in cards. Makers can create sophisticated logic, including data operations performed via Power Platform Connectors, connected to interactive UI elements in the card.
- **Send your cards in Teams**
  Users can post their cards in Teams Channels, chats and meetings. Links to cards will automatically render into a full interactive card inline, filled with data, all while keeping enterprise data securely within an organization.
- Power Apps makers 
- The first wave will build on Dataverse as a backend and use Teams as the target for sharing; we’ll be rapidly lighting up Power Platform connectors and additional sharing options over the coming months
